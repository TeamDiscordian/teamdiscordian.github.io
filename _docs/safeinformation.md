# How To Keep Your Information Safe

Most normal people would not like to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and that is completely fine, The VPN adds another step of security depending on the provider.

**Step 1:** When on websites that you are unsure about then DON'T USE YOUR REAL INFORMATION, I would suggest creating an alias.

**Step 2:** Keep your in the real world email on your phone and don't use it publically on newsletters and such, I would suggest having atleast 2 seperate emails.

**Step 3:** Always, and I MEAN ALWAYS ENABLED 2 STEP VERIFICATION!

**Step 4:** DO NOT PURCHASE OR LOGIN INTO ANYTHING THAT SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE ON FREE WIFI CONNECTIONS! This could lead to someone stealing your information easily.

**Step 5:** Don't trust people you do not know with sensitive information, I would suggest using your "FAKE ALIAS".

``VPN is optional but recommended and it to be offshore.``

``Websites with http ARE NOT SECURE, Websites with https ARE SECURE but doesn't mean your information is safe.``
